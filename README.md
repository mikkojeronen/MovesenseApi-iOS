# MovesenseApi-iOS

Event-based Swift API for communicating with [Movesense](https://www.movesense.com) sensors via Bluetooth LE.

Developed primarily for the needs of Movesense Showcase app, depends on Movesense Device Service (MDS) at [MovesenseMds-iOS](https://github.com/mikkojeronen/MovesenseMds-iOS).

Usage is documented by example, check out [MovesenseShowcase-iOS](https://github.com/mikkojeronen/MovesenseShowcase-iOS) repository.

This repository is my personally maintained fork from the point of time when I left the project, mostly for reference purposes and some tinkering.
